# Data-Engineering

The field of Data Engineering concerns itself with the mechanics for the flow and access of data. Its goal is to make quality data available for fact-finding and data-driven decision making.

**Data Engineers**:
- Designing, Building, Maintaining data infrastructures and platforms
- Develop and optimize data systems
- Make data available for analysis

**Data Analysts**:
- Analyze data in data systems to report and derive insights

**Data Scientists**:
- Perform deeper analysis on data
- Develop predictive models to solve more complex data problems


The **field of Data Engineering involves**:
- Collecting source data (Extracting, integrating, and organizing data from disparate sources)
    - Data acquisition from multiple sources
    - Data architecture for storing source data
- Processing data (Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data to make it usable)
    - Distributed systems for processing data
    - Pipelines for extracting, transforming, and loading data
    - Solutions for safeguarding quality, privacy, and security of data
    - Performance optimization
    - Adherence to compliance guidelines
- Storing data for reliability and easy availability of data
    - Data stores for storage of processed data
    - Scalable systems
    - Ensuring data privacy, security, compliance, monitoring, backup, and recovery
- Making data available to users securely
    - APIs, services, and programs for retrieving data for end-users
    - User access through interfaces and dashboards
    - Checks and balances to ensure data security
